## POKER FACE  

#### A little commentary on the solution

Below are some screenshots that show the output, the test coverage and the passing tests. 

The solution was fully TDD'd so hopefully that will help it meet some of the characteristics being sought. All the lines of executable code are covered, and even the constants and exception values should be tested even though this is not reflected in the percentage.

As with any piece of code there is always scaffolding that can be added but I have tried to focus on making it as svelte and transparent as possible. I did not get the impression from the notes that additional abstractions, interfaces, concurrency, modules etc were being sought so have emitted them in pursuit of clarity and simplicity.
